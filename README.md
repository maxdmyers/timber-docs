# What is Timber?

[Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) helps you create fully-customized [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) themes faster with more sustainable code. With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) separate from your PHP files.

This cleans-up your theme code so your PHP file can focus on supplying the data and logic, while your twig file can focus 100% on the display and HTML.
